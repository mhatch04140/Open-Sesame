## Introduction

In today's world, vehicles come with a wide range of options. The options range from telling you how many miles your car will go on a current gas level to when it's time to change the oil. Furthermore, some cars have options that dim their lights from high beam to low beam when you approach another car.

It is common for people to have something in their hands when approaching a vehicle. If a door could be opened without having to use your hands in these situations, it would be very convenient. Nowadays, most of these options are controlled by motion sensors, which alert the main computer to open the hatch when movement is detected. There is a requirement for one leg to be used with this system. It is difficult for me to operate with one leg and a heavy item in one hand. I would prefer voice-activated accommodation. With voice recognition, any door will be able to be opened by the vehicle operator.

When was the last time you were asked, "Can you unlock your car door?" Next, you must find your keys, go to the window, and unlock the car door with the remote. With this App, you can say, "Ford, unlock all the doors." You can also do this while sitting comfortably.

Since the mid-2000s, cars have had apps that alert you of oil changes, remote starting and stopping, and when the door is opened. Therefore, I'm developing an App to open doors with voice recognition. By walking within twenty feet of your car, you can say, "Ford, open the passenger door." The App would already know your make, model, and VIN number. With this application, you can operate any door in your car.

Furthermore, the vehicle would include safety features to prevent children from getting pinned when the doors are opened or closed. When a signal is received from the door robot arm, the program instructs the car's computer on which way to open or close the door. The vehicle can then be entered and exited safely by children. 
From the car computer to the door operation, the car manufacturer is responsible for all mechanical and computer operations.
