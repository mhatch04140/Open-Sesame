## Introduction 

@author Mike Hatch

In today's world, vehicles come with a wide range of options. The options range from telling you how many miles your car will go on a current gas level to when it's time to change the oil. Furthermore, some cars have options that dim their lights from high beam to low beam when you approach another car.

It is common for people to have something in their hands when approaching a vehicle. If a door could be opened without having to use your hands in these situations, it would be very convenient. Nowadays, most of these options are controlled by motion sensors, which alert the main computer to open the hatch when movement is detected. There is a requirement for one leg to be used with this system. It is difficult for me to operate with one leg and a heavy item in one hand. I would prefer voice-activated accommodation. With voice recognition, any door will be able to be opened by the vehicle operator.

When was the last time you were asked, "Can you unlock your car door?" Next, you must find your keys, go to the window, and unlock the car door with the remote. With this App, you can say, "Ford, unlock all the doors." You can also do this while sitting comfortably.

Since the mid-2000s, cars have had apps that alert you of oil changes, remote starting and stopping, and when the door is opened. Therefore, I'm developing an App to open doors with voice recognition. By walking within twenty feet of your car, you can say, "Ford, open the passenger door." The App would already know your make, model, and VIN number. With this application, you can operate any door in your car.

Furthermore, the vehicle would include safety features to prevent children from getting pinned when the doors are opened or closed. When a signal is received from the door robot arm, the program instructs the car's computer on which way to open or close the door. The vehicle can then be entered and exited safely by children. 
From the car computer to the door operation, the car manufacturer is responsible for all mechanical and computer operations.

Ultimately, this project will only involve a prototype. Currently, there is no plan to replace the existing car system. Our prototype will have an Arduino processor, Bluetooth technology, servo motors to represent the opening and closing of car doors, a handheld device (phone), and LED lights representing go or no go for door operation.
 

## Functional Requirments

### Use case #1 

Goal

A door opens when a handheld device speaks a command to the voice recognition system.

Other Resources Needed

car -> prototype

Handheld Phone

User Action

In order to use the application, the user must first open it. After that, the user touches the Voice Activation Button. The user then says, "Open the right front door." 

Product Action

If all safety conditions are met, a blue tooth signal is transmitted to the car and the computer opens the right front door.

Safty Conditions

Parking Brake must be applied.
Car must be parked.

### Use case #2

Goal

After the handheld device receives a command from the operator, the door closes.

Other Resources Needed

Handheld device

Car -> prototype

User Action
In order to use the app, the user must first open it. The user then presses a voice activation button. The user then says, "Close the right front door." 

Product Action

If all safety conditions are met, a blue tooth signal is transmitted to the car and the computer opens the right front door.

Safty Conditions

Parking Brake must be applied.
Car must be parked.

## Use case #3

The car computer informs the driver that the door cannot be opened due to a blockage.

Goal

Whenever a door is opening and an object is blocking it, an alert appears on the app. 

Other Resources Needed

Car computer 

User Action

As soon as you receive the notification, determine what obstruction is present and remove it if necessary.

Product Action

Your App notifies you when the door is blocked. Upon removing the blocking item and ensuring all safety measures have been implemented.  Normal operations will be carried out by the app.


## Use case #4

The car computer informs the driver that the door cannot close due to a blockage.

Goal

Whenever a door is being closed and an object is blocking it, an alert appears on the app. 

Other Resources Needed

Car Computer

User Action

As soon as you receive the notification, determine what obstruction is present and remove it if necessary.

Product Action

Your App notifies you when the door is blocked. Upon removing the blocking item and ensuring all safety measures have been implemented.  Normal operations will be carried out by the app.

## Use case #5

The system will allow door operation when the parking brake is applied.

Other Resources

N/A

Goal

It will not be possible to operate the App if the parking brake is not applied. App will complete the operation if parking brake is applied.

User Action

Make sure the parking brake has been applied before leaving a parked car. The App can then be used since the parking brake has been taken care of.

Product Action

When the parking brake is applied, the car sends the safety signal that the break has been applied.

## Use case #6

A task is being asked of the App while the car is moving.

Goal

It is not possible to activate the App using voice if there is movement in the tire rotation.

Other Resources

Initially, this will be a LED light that monitors tire rotation. For no tire rotation, the LED light will be green, while for tire rotation, it will be red.

User Action

In the event that a voice command is given, but not completed, the APP will display a "tire rolling error." The user must stop the car.
Voice commands can then be used.


Product action

When the LED light on the APP turns green, the voice commands can be completed.  There will be no operation of the App if the LED light is red.

Arduino Uno [Tech Specs](https://docs.arduino.cc/resources/datasheets/A000066-datasheet.pdf?_gl=1*1tzapmj*_ga*MjEyODY5MjA4MS4xNjYzNDU4MDg0*_ga_NEXN8H46L5*MTY2MzQ1ODA4NC4xLjEuMTY2MzQ1OTkxMy4wLjAuMA)


### Security

App security will consist of a user name and password to protect against unautorized access. Security between the app and bluetooth module will consist of  pin matching to ensure that the app is connecting to the correct bluetooth device.

### User Characteristics

The mobile application's user interface needs to be simple, user friendly, and easy to use. The purpose of the system is make it easier for a user to open a car door when they may be otherwise burdened with thier hands full.

In order for the system to benefit a user, the system must be as simple as possible.

1. The app must load quickly and after a brief splash screen the app needs to be ready to use.

2. Once on the main screen one button press should set the app in a state to recieve voice commands.

3. If a valid command is issued then no further user action should be required to open or close a door.

4. If an error or safety stoppage occurs then the app should clearly communicate the nature of the failure to the user.

### Documentation

**Design Documentation.** This document shall be a detailed design that describes how the various components of the system work. It may include block diagrams, schematics, or code snippets, as appropriate. The audience of this document is other develoers who might want to understand and extend the system.

**User Documentation.** This document shall describe how to install, configure, and use the system. The audience of this document is people who want to use the system without understanding the internal operation of the system

**Website.** A website shall be produced that describes the system. The audience of this site is potential users considering the system and current users looking for technical support. This site can be hosted anywhere that is convenient

### Data Formats

Mobile app input methods will consist of both voice commands and button presses. The app will connect with the development board via bluetooth. Bluetooth 2.0 will be used.

The development board will connect to 4 servos that opens individual doors. The 4 servos will use the PWM pins on the dev board.

### Internationalization

Open Seasame will only support english at this time.

### Environment

The mobile application will exist in a userâ€™s Android device and will be subject to the environmental conditions that the user subjects their mobile phone to.

For the purpose of this prototype, the door opening system will not be subjected to any austere environmental conditions. In this case water, dirt, grease, road salt, etc. does not need to be a factor.

If the system was to move beyond a prototype or proof of concept then adverse environmental factors would need to be considered. In a production environment the door opening system would need to be weatherproof or located in an area of the vehicle that would mitigate these concerns. For example, if the system was to move to production, then the system would need to be robust enough to function in temperatures ranging from -40 degrees Fahrenheit to 120 degrees Fahrenheit. The system would need to be waterproof, resistant to interference from dirt, grease, and salt. It would also need to withstand severe vibration and be reliable enough to be used indefinably with possibly thousands of door openings.

### Expected Enhancements

No expected enhancements expected beyond delivery of initial prototype.

### Date

The final presentation will be on or about the last day of classes of the Spring 2023 semester. The final demonstration and the documentation will be due at the end of finals week.
