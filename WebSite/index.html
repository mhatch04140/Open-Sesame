   <p> Open Sesame is a protoype that is designed to operate car doors
       from a hand help device. Open Sesame is a protoype that is designed
       to operate car doors from a hand help device.</p>
   
   <p>Hardware is the second major subsystem. The hardware subsystem will
      consist of a microcontroller and Bluetooth transmitter/receiver. 
      The microcontroller will receive inputs from the app through the 
      Bluetooth receiver. The microcontroller will have several inputs
      and outputs that make the system work successfully and safely.</P>

    <p>The third major component is the vehicle it’s self and the door
      actuator. The microcontroller will receive inputs from the vehicle
      showing if the vehicle’s parking brake engaged or disengaged, if 
      the doors are locked or unlocked, and if the vehicle’s security 
      system is engaged. If the parking brake is engaged then and only 
      then can the system be enabled. The microcontroller will also have 
      output signals that inform the app about the current state of the
      vehicle, a signal to disengage a security system, a signal to unlock
      the doors or selected door, and a signal to open the selected door. 
      The doors will be opened with some sort of mechanism that opens
      the door.<p>
